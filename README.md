## 1. Overview

This project builds **completely isolated development environments per project** by Layer 2 level, accessible securely via VPN.\
It's a blueprint for **low-cost distributed development**, offshore projects, or private team labs.

### 1.1. What You Get (Engineer's Perspective)

On a single Proxmox VE node: 
- Per-project, fully isolated network segments with VPN-secured access for remote teammates. 
- Expose each project's environment to your team without risking the main LAN. 
- Secure design --- no packets other than VPN tunnels traverse and DNS inquiry into your corporate or home LAN.
- Automated client provisioning: user registration, certificate generation, and VPN management via Prutunl GUI.
- GUI-based server control (start/stop per project VPN). 
- No VLAN-capable switches required.
- **Corporate Edition only** Self-service VM management within your project network: project members can independently create, delete, start, stop VMs, and manage snapshots and backups without administrator intervention.

For those who just want to build it now --- jump to [Quickstart](#2-quickstart).

### 1.2. What You Get (Manager's Perspective)

- Grant access **only to what each partner/freelancer needs**, preventing cross-project leaks by design.
- Build a **private development cloud** for small/mid-size software firms or startups.
- Safer, faster, and cheaper than giving developers full cloud freedom.
- Entirely open-source --- all you need is **one small server (even a NUC)** and \~¥1,000/month for electricity.
- No vendor lock-in, no subscription required.

> Equivalent commercial setups cost millions of yen with maintenance contracts.\
> This achieves the same goal for (almost) zero cost.

### 1.4. Licensing

-   **Pritunl**\
    Free to use, with optional paid features for enterprise management.\
    A single enterprise license covers all servers in the cluster.\
    → [Pritunl](https://pritunl.com)

-   **Proxmox VE**\
The core Proxmox VE (PVE) software is open source and licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3 (AGPL v3). According to the official Proxmox stance, no “license fee” is charged — meaning there is no cost required to use the software itself. [Proxmox][1], [Proxmox Forum][2] \
However, paid subscriptions (support contracts) are offered separately.

### 1.5. Target Audience

- “We already let our developers freely spin up AWS instances to build a fast, distributed development environment. Security? Well… when someone asks that, management and executives of small software houses just glance at the person in charge for help.”
- “I have my own development/lab environment at home, so I aggressively spin up VMs and develop there. Other team members? I assume they’re each figuring things out on their own?”
- “These days I use WSL and run Linux VMs on my Windows PC. Security if I lose my PC? BitLocker keeps it safe… or so they say. Everyone develops in totally different environments. Integration testing takes forever (lol).”
- “Even in large enterprises, right. Servers are in the server room with strict access control. Basically, no personal data exists in the development environment. NDAs with each employee? Yes, we enforce those. And of course you can only log in through VDI. But the root password for all VMs is the same. And because they’re all on the same segment… theoretically, if someone wanted to log in to other VMs? They could, haha.”
- “Also in large enterprises: projects that need it each have their own VPN. If you can log into one VM, could you get into others too? I haven’t checked, but I don’t think so… We’ve never had such an incident. Plus, we conduct security training twice a year.”

### 1.6. Why This Matters

#### 1.6.1. Typical Problems in Cloud Dev Environments

Typical “Pain Points” When Development Environments Live in the Public Cloud
- Still assigning a public IP directly to the VM and SSHing straight into it
- Because it has a public IP, your untested web application server is actually exposed to the entire Internet
- Development environments across projects are visible to each other
- Spinning up a flood of instances without considering the blast radius
- Network bandwidth dying because of large data transfers (yes, that old meme)
- Approval → Estimation → Approval → Provisioning… What is “development speed” again?
- “Just for testing” instances … left running for six months
- Falling asleep waiting for builds on a weak CPU instance

    Are we really safe letting application developers with low security literacy — or people who “think they understand infrastructure” — operate the cloud freely?
    They’re not malicious. They simply lack the mechanisms required to fulfill the responsibilities expected of them.
    The result: exploding costs, expanded attack surfaces, permission spaghetti, and the phenomenon of
“Turns out on-prem was safer after all.”

**Result:** High cost, low visibility, accidental exposure.\
Even with best intentions, teams lack the "systemic guardrails" that prevent human error.

### 1.7. Cost Efficiency Example
Let’s compare AWS EC2 c5d.large (2 vCPUs) with a 2-vCPU VM running on an Intel NUC.\
The machine used in this project: Intel NUC Pro, Core i7-1360P (12 cores / 16 threads, up to 5.0 GHz).

## 2. Quickstart

All open-source components --- reproducible setup from scratch.

### 2.1. Requirements

-   One Proxmox VE 9.0+ host
-   Internet router (for port forwarding VPN traffic)
-   Static IP (for Pritunl)
-   Optional: Cloudflare tunnel for GUI access

**Required packages** (auto-installed by setup scripts):
-   `git` - Retrieve the MSL Setup repository (Personal Edition)
-   `ipcalc` - Network address calculation utility
-   `jq` - JSON processing tool
-   `zip` - Archive extraction utility
-   `wget` or `curl` - Cloud-init image download
-   `sha256sum` - Image integrity verification

### 2.2. Network Design Considerations

You will need to provide the following network addresses, which must be configured appropriately.
If your environment has no additional subnets other than the one connected to Proxmox VE, you can generally keep the example values below as-is — except for (a) and (b), which should be set according to your actual network to avoid conflicts.

![Zelogx MSL Setup Network Overview](docs/assets/zelogx-MSL-Setup-withID.svg)

#### a. MainLan (existing vmbr0): (e.g., 192.168.77.0/24 GW: .254)
- The network address of your company or home lab’s main LAN.
- This LAN is likely connected to smart speakers, TVs, game consoles, employees’ or family members’ PCs and smartphones, as well as lab-related VMs (such as web servers, Cloudflared, Nextcloud, Samba, personal OpenVPN/WireGuard servers, Unbound DNS, etc.).\
However, all VMs belonging to individual projects (VMnPJxx) are completely isolated by the PVE Firewall and vnet, ensuring secure separation.
- The “Pritunl mainlan-side IP” configured later must fall within this IP range.
- Since most internet routers can only perform port forwarding to LAN-side IP addresses, it is recommended that the Proxmox VE host be connected directly under the router’s LAN segment.

#### b. Proxmox PVE’s mainlan IP: (e.g., 192.168.77.7)
- This becomes the destination IP when adding a static route to the Internet router. (Auto-detected, for display)

#### c. vpndmzvn (new): (e.g., 192.168.80.0/24 GW: 192.168.80.1)
- Route used by VPN clients to access development project subnets.
- Requires at least a /30 network.

#### d. Client-distributed IPs: (e.g., 192.168.81.0/24)
- Separated for wg and ovpn. Example: 192.168.81.2–126/25, 192.168.81.129–254/25
- Further divided into /28 based on the “number of isolated development segments to be created.”
- Maximum VPN-capable clients per project is 13. For offshore distributed development, securing more would be better.

#### e. Number of isolated development segments (number of projects) to create: (e.g., 8)
- Minimum is 2, and must be a power of two: 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.
- If the number of projects is 8: project IDs will be 01–08, and segments will be vnetpj01 to vnetpj08.

#### f. Network address assigned to each project (vnetpjxx) (new): (e.g., 172.16.16.0/20)
- Network segment for each project. This IP range is divided according to the “number of isolated development segments to be created.”
- Example: If the network address assigned to vnetpjxx is 172.16.16.0/20 and you are creating 8 segments, it will be divided accordingly as shown below.
- VM groups inside vnetpjxx (172.16.16.0/24) can communicate freely within that segment.
- Firewall settings for these VMs are controlled by Security Groups (SG).
- These segments are mapped to a Pritunl server instances and organization.

#### g. Pritunl mainlan-side IP: (e.g., 192.168.77.10)
- This becomes the forwarding destination IP when adding port-forwarding rules on the Internet router.

#### h. Pritunl vpndmzvn-side IP: (e.g., 192.168.80.2)
- Subnet used by Pritunl clients when they exit toward each project’s subnet. Minimum /30 is sufficient but we allocate a larger /24 here.

#### i. UDP ports: 
- Number of isolated development segments (projects) × 2 = (16)

**Note:**
- Some routers limit the number of port-forwarding entries. For example, Buffalo routers allow a maximum of 32. Therefore, when deciding value 5, you should also consider your router’s maximum port-forwarding capacity.
- Also, if you are using IPoE with ND Proxy / MAP-E / DS-Lite, there are restrictions on available ports, so you must check in advance.

### 2.3. Installation (Proxmox VE 9.0)

``` bash
apt update -y
apt install -y ipcalc jq zip
apt install -y python3-pyinstaller
# Place the place zip file on the proxmox server using scp or similar.

# In Corporate edition,
unzip msl-setup-pro-1.x.x_corporate.zip    # change x to correct version number
cd proxmox-msl-setup-1.x.x_corporate
# In MSL Setup (Personal Edition),
git clone https://github.com/zelogx/msl-setup.git
cd msl-setup

# Phase 1: Network Setup (check config + SDN setup)
./01_networkSetup.sh en   # Language: en|jp (default en)
# This will execute:
#   1. 0101_checkConfigNetwork.sh - Generate .env interactively
#   2. 0102_setupNetwork.sh - Apply SDN configuration (zones, vnets, subnets, IPSets, firewall)

# After Phase 1, configure your router (port forwarding and static routes)
# Follow the instructions displayed at the end of Phase 1

# Phase 2: VPN Setup (Pritunl VM deployment + configuration)
./02_vpnSetup.sh en   # Language: en|jp (default en)
# This will execute:
#   1. 0201_createPritunlVM.sh - Deploy Pritunl VM (Ubuntu 24.04 LTS with cloud-init)
#      - Collect existing VM inventory (audit trail)
#      - Auto-allocate VMID starting from 100
#      - Auto-generate SSH key if none exists
#      - Download Ubuntu 24.04 cloud-init image (cached for reuse)
#      - Create VM with 2 NICs (vmbr0/MainLAN, vpndmzvn)
#      - Configure static IPs and routes via cloud-init
#      - Validate network configuration remotely
#   2. 0202_configurePritunl.sh - Configure Pritunl servers, organizations, and users

# Phase 3 (Pro Corporate only): RBAC Self-Care Portal Setup
./0203_setupSelfCarePortal.sh en   # Language: en|jp (default en)
# This will:
#   1. Backup current RBAC state (pools, groups, users, ACL, firewall rules)
#   2. Check for ACL conflicts with existing resources
#   3. Prompt for storage device selection (to assign to project pools)
#   4. Create NUM_PJ pools, admin groups, and user accounts
#   5. Generate random passwords for each project admin user
#   6. Assign Pool and SDN Zone permissions to project groups
#   7. Add firewall rules for VPN user access to Proxmox GUI (port 8006)
#   8. Display project credentials (username, password) in table format
# Supports --restore option to delete all project RBAC resources and restore to backup state
#
# With this phase, project members including VPN users gain self-service VM management
# capabilities within their isolated project network: VM creation/deletion, start/stop,
# snapshot creation, and backup management — all without requiring administrator intervention.
#
# **PRO CORPORATE EDITION ONLY**: This feature is included in the Pro Corporate edition.
# For Community Edition users, this phase is optional and requires manual user/pool setup.
```

# (Optional) Uninstall MSL setup completely
./99_uninstall.sh en   # Language: en|jp (default en)
# This will:
#   1. Destroy Pritunl VM (calls 0201_createPritunlVM.sh --destroy)
#   2. Restore network configuration to backup state (calls 0102_setupNetwork.sh --restore)
# IMPORTANT: Before running uninstall, ensure all VMs/CTs using vnetpjXX are removed or
#            their NICs are changed to a different bridge (e.g., vmbr0)
# Default is No - requires explicit confirmation (y/yes) to proceed
```

Argument Policy (v2.0):
- Scripts accept only: language code (en|jp) and optional --restore/--destroy (where supported)
- Unknown arguments cause an error and English usage output
- Usage messages are English-only by design (spec requirement)
- Library files (env_generator.sh, svg_generator.sh) are not directly executable; they print usage and exit if run directly

## 3. Known Issues

- **Network diagram theme behavior**  
    The color scheme of SVG-based network diagrams does **not** follow the Proxmox GUI theme (Light/Dark).  
    Instead, it respects the OS / browser `prefers-color-scheme` setting.  
    As a result, when your OS or browser is set to light mode, the diagram may appear with light-theme colors even if the Proxmox GUI is using the dark theme (and vice versa).

## 4. Why This Design Still Matters

Public clouds deliver global scale and strong SLAs — no argument there.
But when the goal is controlled, secure, and cost-efficient team development, a well-designed on-prem environment still has a place.

This architecture proves that small software teams, SaaS startups, and serious home-lab engineers can build isolated, compliant, production-grade development labs without burning money or giving up autonomy.

Security, performance, and independence don’t have to be trade-offs.
They can coexist — by design.
